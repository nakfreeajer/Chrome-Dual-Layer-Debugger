# Architecture

## Core principle

Playwright owns ordinary semantic browser interaction. For normal pages, low-level CDP observation should prefer Playwright public `CDPSession` access. The GAS layer is enabled only when the current page URL starts with `https://script.google.com/macros/`.

## Runtime architecture

              +-- BROWSER_PLUS_GAS
                        |
                        +-- GasAdapter
                              |
                              +-- gas-remote-debug
                                    +-- browser-root CDP
                                    +-- Target discovery
                                    +-- recursive OOPIF/session discovery
                                    +-- execution-context discovery

All adapters -> normalized TraceEvent -> Timeline -> JSONL
```

## GAS detection

The v0.1 detector is intentionally deterministic and simple:

```text
currentUrl.startsWith("https://script.google.com/macros/")
  -> BROWSER_PLUS_GAS
otherwise
  -> BROWSER_ONLY
```

Detection and runtime discovery are separate concerns. The URL rule decides whether `GasAdapter` is required; `gas-remote-debug` then performs GAS-specific discovery.

## GAS composition decision

Do not fork or duplicate the recursive CDP engine already present in `nakfreeajer/gas-remote-debug`.

`GasAdapter` composes that package for browser-root target discovery, recursive attachment, target/session/frame/execution-context registries, runtime-context selection, safe evaluation, and redaction.

Chrome-Dual-Layer-Debugger remains responsible for:
- selecting the page/session under inspection;
- URL-based mode detection;
- Playwright semantic control;
- normal page/frame CDP observations;
- cross-layer identity mapping where it can be proven;
- assigning unified event/trace identity;
- chronological normalization into one timeline.

## Identity rule

Playwright Page/Frame identity, CDP TargetId/FrameId/SessionId, and GAS execution-context identity are related but not assumed identical. `TargetRegistry` records only mappings supported by evidence.

## Trace rule

Every observation may have an `eventId`. A higher-level `traceId` is assigned only when deterministic evidence links events. Timestamp proximity alone is not proof of correlation.

## Low-intrusion rule

Observation is the default. Do not navigate, close, click, type, mutate DOM/runtime state, or close the browser unless the active bounded milestone explicitly authorizes it.

## Engineering workflow architecture

The project uses an AMO-inspired Human -> Architect-Curator -> Executor authority model, but **no automated Orchestrator is part of this project**. Relay is performed manually by the Human Owner. Repository governance and the software runtime architecture are independent concerns.
